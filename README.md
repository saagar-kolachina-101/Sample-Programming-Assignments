# README

In this Repository are some recent programming assignments to view as reference. Here is a description of the provided examples. 




# TAM470 Project 1

This python notebook contains worked code used in order to model a double swing pendulum, and then implement the Leapfrog, RK4, and AB2 schemes as a way to measure the change in energy of the system over time.

# TAM470 Project 2

This notebook contains worked code to implement the Finite Element Method of a given shape using triangular mesh nodes based on node position as well as a solution to a 2D Transient Heat PDE with a laser heating source and corresponding plots.

# Computational Materials Science Lab Paper - Band Gap Prediction with Machine Learning

Though fairly unorganized, I have provided the code I used in order to write the paper labeled "404-MAC Term Report_SaagarKolachina (1).pdf" in this repo. It includes calling datasets, featurizing the data, training random forest models, performing hyperparameter optimization of the models, and discussing impact of this methodology.
